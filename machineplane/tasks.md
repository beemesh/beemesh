1. Extract the encryption / signing logic from the CLI into the crypto crate. The crypto is a library and shall contain all required crypto logic to be used by machine and cli.
2. Each libp2p node in machine should create a key pair on startup and store this keypair on disk in /etc/beemesh/machine. Add a CLI option for machine to optionally store this key-pair and the libp2p key-pair in memory for ephemeral nodes.
3. Ensure that machine/src/libp2p_beemesh/behaviour/gossipsub_message.rs (and its corresponding flatbuffers are correctly signed)
4. Replace all println! with proper standard logging in rust. Use debug! or info! or error! depending on the the content of the println! statement.
